# drone_nucleo_F446RE
This is the software used in the Nucleo-F446RE demo board for drones.

## Compiler
The project was generated by **STM32CubeIDE 1.18.1** and uses
**GNU Tools for STM32** version **13.3.rel1**. This toolchain provides
`arm-none-eabi-gcc` for compiling the firmware.

## Building with `make`
STM32CubeIDE generates a `makefile` in the `Release` directory. You can
build the firmware on the command line without the IDE by running:

```bash
cd Release
make all
```

The resulting binary will be `drone_nucleo_F446RE.elf` in the same
directory, ready to be flashed to the board.
